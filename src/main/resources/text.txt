what is lorem ipsumlorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry lorem
ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the s when an unknown printer took a
galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book it has survived not only five centuries
but also the leap into electronic typesetting remaining essentially unchanged it was popularised in
the s with the release of letraset sheets containing lorem ipsum passages and more recently with
desktop publishing software like aldus pagemaker including versions of lorem ipsumwhy do we use
itit is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
when looking at its layout the point of using lorem ipsum is that it has a moreorless normal distribution
of letters as opposed to using content here content here making it look like readable english many desktop
publishing packages and web page editors now use lorem ipsum as their default model text and a search for
lorem ipsum will uncover many web sites still in their infancy various versions have evolved over the years
sometimes by accident sometimes on purpose injected humour and the likewhere does it come fromcontrary to
popular belief lorem ipsum is not simply random text it has roots in a piece of classical latin literature
from  bc making it over  years old richard mcclintock a latin professor at hampdensydney college in virginia
looked up one of the more obscure latin words consectetur from a lorem ipsum passage and going through the
cites of the word in classical literature discovered the undoubtable source lorem ipsum comes from sections
and  of de finibus bonorum et malorum the extremes of good and evil by cicero written in  bc this book is
a treatise on the theory of ethics very popular during the renaissance the first line of lorem ipsum lorem
ipsum dolor sit amet comes from a line in section the standard chunk of lorem ipsum used since the s is reproduced
below for those interested sections  and  from de finibus bonorum et malorum by cicero are also reproduced in their
exact original form accompanied by english versions from the  translation by h rackhamwhere can i get somethere are
many variations of passages of lorem ipsum available but the majority have suffered alteration in some form by injected
humour or randomised words which dont look even slightly believable if you are going to use a passage of lorem ipsum you
need to be sure there isnt anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text all the lorem ipsum generators on the internet
tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary making this the first true generator on the internet it uses a dictionary of
over  latin words combined with a handful of model sentence structures to generate lorem ipsum which looks reasonable the
generated lorem ipsum is therefore always free from repetition injected humour or noncharacteristic words etc
